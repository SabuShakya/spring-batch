# Spring Batch #

## Batch Processing ##
- bulk-oriented, non-interactive, long-running background execution. A batch process handles bulk data and runs for long
time.
- computationally intensive data processing, may execute sequentially or parallel. Initiated through various invocation 
models: ad hoc, scheduled and on-demand.
  
## Spring Batch ##
- light weight, comprehensive framework designed to facilitate development of robust batch applications.
- supports extremely high volume, high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques.
- is flexible, scalable, maintainable,reliable, supports multiple file formats, multiple ways to launch a job.
